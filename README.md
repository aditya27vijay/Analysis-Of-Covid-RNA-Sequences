# COVID RNA Analysis: Exploring Variants and Mutations

## 📚 Overview

This project dives into the **RNA sequences of COVID-19**, including the **Delta** and **Omicron** variants. We explore sequence metadata, download RNA sequences from the NIH database, and align sequences to identify mutation points. The analysis is performed on actual RNA sequences in **FASTA format**, with a hands-on approach to downloading and processing RNA data from around the world.

## ✨ Features

- 📜 **Metadata Exploration**: Understand the structure and significance of RNA metadata.  
- 🌎 **Global Data Access**: Download real RNA sequences from the NIH database.  
- 🧬 **Sequence Alignment**: Identify and analyze mutation points across variants.  
- 📂 **Hands-On Learning**: Work directly with RNA sequences in **FASTA format**.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Core programming language for analysis.
  - Libraries:  
    - [Biopython](https://biopython.org/): For parsing and handling biological data.  
    - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): For visualizing mutation patterns.
    - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): For metadata manipulation.  
- **FASTA Format**: RNA sequence format.  
- **NIH Database**: Source for downloading global RNA sequences.
